This is a Telegram bot designed to assist beginners in learning the Python language. The bot includes detailed descriptions of the language's data types, modules, and functions. It also offers a set of simple tasks and their solutions. Additionally, a link to PEP 8 is provided, and a job vacancy parser is added. This is a trial project that does not claim any high awards but can be useful to someone. Both the project itself and its code may be helpful.

The project was developed by two developers, which resulted in some differences in coding style. However, this can actually be helpful if you are writing your first bot and want to see how it's done using existing code as an example.

!!!Don't forget to create a config.py file and add your bot's token there!
